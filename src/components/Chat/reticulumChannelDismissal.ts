/**
 * Pure decision helper for the Q-Chat "dismiss OS notifications for the
 * channel on screen" effect.
 *
 * The effect itself is deliberately separate from the read effect, because
 * dismissal has no timestamp, unread-count, or loaded-event precondition. The
 * read effect gates `markRead` behind a deferral so the unread divider
 * survives scroll restoration; keeping dismissal there meant it sat downstream
 * of early returns and was skipped whenever the selected channel was already
 * the stored channel. This helper makes the decision testable without mounting
 * a 13k-line component.
