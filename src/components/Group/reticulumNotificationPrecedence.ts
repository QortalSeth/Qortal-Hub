/**
 * Notification-type precedence for Q-Chat group posts.
 *
 * A single post can match several notification kinds at once: a reply that also
 * mentions the reader, a mention that also matches "all messages", and so on.
 * Each post must produce **at most one** OS notification, and it must be the
 * most specific kind that applies. Emitting one per matched kind produced two
 * notifications for one post whenever the push level was "all".
 *
 * Precedence, most specific first:
 *
 *   reply  >  mention  >  message
 *
 * Reactions are a different event type (`reaction_add`) and never compete with
 * these — a reaction is never also a message.
 *
 * The emitter in `Group.tsx` evaluates these in order and stops at the first
 * kind that fires. This module exists because the ordering was previously
 * implicit in nested booleans, and one of the guards read variables that were
 * only assigned inside an earlier branch — so "skipped" and "not applicable"
 * were indistinguishable, and the generic notification fired alongside the
 * specific one.

//
// The four handlers in `WebsocketNotifications.tsx` each owned a private

// consulted the push-level settings at all. So:
//

//   - a reply fired even at `pushLevel: 'none'` with `notifyOnReplies: false`,
//     contradicting the emitter, which honours both.
//
// Both are fixed by making every handler ask the same question, and by keying
// the answer on the event rather than on the handler.
