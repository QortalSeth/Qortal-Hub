/**
 * Reproduction + regression guard for "the unread badge does not appear".
 *
 * The reported symptom: after a fresh start or a rejoin, a group shows no unread
 * badge and the channel dot is missing too — while OS notifications keep firing,
 * because they never consult the read watermark.
 *
 * Two defects produce that. This scenario exercises both against the shipping
 * code: the real `ReticulumChatManager` over real SQLite for the watermark half,
 * and the real `src/utils/qChatNotificationSettings.ts` for the counting half.
 *
 * The assertions are written as documented behaviour, not as observations of the
 * current implementation, so they FAIL while the defects exist and pass once
 * they are fixed. Running it before and after the fix is the confirmation the
 * change asks for (tasks 1.4 and 5.4).

/**
 * Defect C: one sender's clock pushes the read watermark past another's message.
 *
 * `computeChannelSummary` counts a message unread when
 * `event.timestamp > watermark`. Both sides come from *senders'* clocks, so the
 * watermark is a value in one participant's clock space that is then compared
 * against every other participant's clock. A sender whose clock runs ahead
 * therefore writes a watermark in the future, and every later message whose
 * timestamp falls under it is silently treated as read.
 *
 * The reported symptom is exactly this shape: a push notification for a post
 * that produced no badge. Notifications are generated from live events and never
 * consult the watermark, so they keep firing while the count stays zero. The
 * intermittency follows too — it needs a fast-clocked sender to have dragged the
 * watermark ahead first.
 *
 * The existing guard does not cover this direction. `markChannelsRead` clamps a
 * watermark *down* to the newest stored event, which stops the reader's own wall
 * clock poisoning it, but a stored event timestamped in the future is what it
 * clamps *to* — so the future watermark survives as legitimate.
